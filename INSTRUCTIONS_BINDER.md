Setting up the project in Binder

Go to https://mybinder.org/
.

Enter the following parameters:

GitHub repository name or URL
– Paste the HTTPS link to the GitHub repository.
(On the repository page click Code → HTTPS → Copy to get the link).

For each part (1-2-3) create a unique Binder link, one for each branch on GitHub.

File to open (in JupyterLab)
– Change the option from “File” to “URL” and type:  /rstudio

Important: This ensures the project opens in RStudio instead of Jupyter.

Click Launch and wait—starting the Binder environment can take a few minutes.

When the environment is ready, copy the generated Binder link and save it somewhere safe.
This link is the only way to launch this Binder setup again.
