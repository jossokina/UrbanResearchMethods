# Urban Research Methods
## Data Challenge 2: Linear Models

This assignment is completed by **modifying and running specific code boxes** provided in the assignment document.

## How to Work on the Assignment

1. For each question, read the instructions carefully.
2. The question specifies **which code box (A–C)** is required.
3. Copy the corresponding code box from the assignment document.
4. Paste the code into **`main.R` in RStudio (Binder)**.
   - Comments in the code indicate **where each block should be pasted**.
5. Modify the code if necessary.
   - Red lines in the code indicate **lines to be modified**.
6. Run the pasted code.

## Outputs

- Depending on the question, results will appear:
  - in the **R console** (e.g. model summaries),
  - as **tables saved to HTML files** in the `tables/` folder.

## Notes
- Do **not** modify or add libraries; all required packages are already provided.
- Use the **training dataset** to estimate models and the **test dataset** for predictions.
- Run the code blocks exactly as instructed, adjusting only variables or model specifications when explicitly requested.
