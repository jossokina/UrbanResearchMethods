# Urban Research Methods
## Data Challenge 1 – Instructions

This assignment is completed by **modifying and running specific code boxes** provided in the assignment document.

## How to Work on the Assignment

1. For each question, read the instructions carefully.
2. The question specifies **which code box (A–E)** is required.
3. Copy the corresponding code box from the assignment document.
4. Paste the code into **`main.R` in RStudio**.
   - Comments in the code indicate **where each block should be pasted**.
5. Modify the code if necessary
   - Red lines in the code indicate **lines to be modified**
6. Run the pasted code.

## Outputs

- Depending on the question, results will appear:
  - in the **R console** (e.g. summaries, correlations), or
  - as **plots saved to PDF files** in the `figures/` folder, or
  - as **tables saved to HTML files** in the `tables/` folder.

## Notes
- Do **not** modify or add libraries; all required packages are already provided.
- Run the code blocks exactly as instructed, adjusting only labels or variable selections when explicitly requested.
