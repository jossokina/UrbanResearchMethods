### Important: Do not change these constants; they represent the optimal parameters for the models.

helpers.R â€“ Contains the auxiliary function summarize_feature_importance_trees() which students should use to retrieve the feature importance of the tree models and return it as a table.

### Important: Do not modify this script and do not use other libraries for the tree models, otherwise the function will not work.

Data must be contained in the folder ./data.
